# 1. MME Fundamentals #

(from [Wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Architecture_Evolution))

The Mobility Management Entity is the key control-node for the LTE access-network.

* It is responsible for idle mode UE (User Equipment) paging and tagging procedure including retransmissions.
* It is involved in the bearer activation/deactivation process and is also responsible for choosing the SGW for a UE at the initial attach and at time of intra-LTE handover involving Core Network (CN) node relocation.
* It is responsible for authenticating the user (by interacting with the HSS).
* The Non Access Stratum (NAS) signaling terminates at the MME and it is also responsible for generation and allocation of temporary identities to UEs.
* It checks the authorization of the UE to camp on the service provider's Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) and enforces UE roaming restrictions.
* The MME is the termination point in the network for ciphering/integrity protection for NAS signaling and handles the security key management.
* Lawful interception of signaling is also supported by the MME.
* The MME also provides the control plane function for mobility between LTE and 2G/3G access networks with the S3 interface terminating at the MME from the SGSN.
* The MME also terminates the S6a interface towards the HSS for roaming UEs.
