   \brief We still use some unix commands for convenience, and we did not have
   to replace them by system calls \ Instead of calling C system(...) that can
   take a lot of time (creation of a process, etc), in many cases \ it doesn't
   hurt to do this asynchronously, may be we must tweak thread priority, pin it
   to a CPU, etc (TODO later) \author  Lionel GAUTHIER \date 2017 \email:
